Requirements:
Tree Geometry:

Canopy Diameter (D) and Height (H): Helps determine shadow length and shape on neighboring trees.
Leaf Density and Leaf Area Index (LAI): Affects light penetration through the canopy.
Plantation Layout:

Tree Spacing (S): Influences canopy overlap and shading.
Row Orientation (if applicable): Affects sunlight exposure based on sun’s path.
Geographical Data:

Latitude (Lat) and Longitude (Long): Essential for solar angle calculations.
Elevation (Elev): Impacts sunlight intensity due to atmospheric thickness.
Environmental Conditions:

Seasonal Sunlight Variation: Adjusts for annual changes in sunlight.
Weather Data: Includes historical cloud cover for better long-term sunlight estimates.
Key Equations:
Solar Position Calculations:

Solar Declination (δ): δ = 23.45 * sin((360/365) * (284 + N))
Solar Hour Angle (HRA): HRA = 15° * (t - 12)
Solar Zenith Angle (θz): cos(θz) = sin(δ) * sin(Lat) + cos(δ) * cos(Lat) * cos(HRA)
Shadow Length (L): L = H / tan(θz)

Canopy Shading and Overlap:

Overlap Area (O): O = D^2 * cos(θ) * sin(θ)
Adjusted Sunlight Exposure:

Direct Sunlight Reduction Factor (DSR): DSR = 1 - (Overlap Area (O) / Canopy Area (A))
Total Sunlight Exposure (TSE): TSE = Σ (DSR * LAI adjustment * hourly irradiance)
Weather Adjustments:

Cloud Cover Adjustment Factor (CCF): Adjusted Sunlight Exposure = TSE * (1 - CCF)
